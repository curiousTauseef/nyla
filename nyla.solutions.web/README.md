# NYLA Web

NYLA Web is a project expands on NYLA's Command pattern (a.k.a. COMMAS) for building REST/web services. It implements its own Model View Controller pattern for pure JEE or web containers (ex: Jetty) MicroServices. This project provides NYLA's Query Service pattern for searches abstracted through web services.
